		"- Prepare the chicken in medium cubes, removing bones and extra fat.",

		"- Prepare and mix the spices.",
		"- Spread it on the chicken and leave it covered for at least 8 h.",
		"# Grilling the chicken",
		"You can either do this in a pan or in the oven. I use the oven. After pre-heating, set at 220ÂºC (convection) for 21'.",
		"Prepare the next spice mix and leave the cashews on some boiling water",
		"# Making the sauce",
		"- On the same pot, open a spot on the center and add the ingredients listed, previously mixed, except the tomato and cashews.",
		"- After 1-2', before the spices burn, add some water with the passata / blended tomatoes / tomatoes boiled and crushed separately.",
		"- Blend the cashew liquid finely, pour it in.",
		"# Finishing",
		"- After left out for some time, you should be able to see traces of fat on top. Add heavy cream and reduce for 2-3'.",
		"- Throw in the fine leaves. Doing so before is also possible but they will turn black."

			"Some people add onions. But the whole point of butter chicken is having a silky smooth sauce. Onions will mess with it.",
			"To counteract tomato acidity, instead of adding sugar or onions, you can slowly add to the sauce sodium bicarbonate. Mix it and taste it after every time.",
			"If you are not used to hot spicy food, reduce the amount of Kashmiri chili powder."
