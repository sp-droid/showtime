		"- Wash well the vegetables. Peel the garlic and cucumber. Roughly cut this one together with the tomatoes and pepper. Also split the bread in smaller bits.",
		"- Blend everything well, adding water to correct for consistency. Should be somewhere between a soup and a pureè. If you used tomatoes instead of passata, now strain it to remove bits of skin and seeds.",
		"- Put in the fridge and serve when cold (though I do like it when made in the moment)"
