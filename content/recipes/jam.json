    "description": "In Lanzarote we have the best black mulberries I've ever tasted. Unfortunately, I only get the chance to have some in June-July, which prompted me to make jam (and start with the strawberry one) and enjoy them longer. This recipe is not too sweet nor it needs any artificial source for pectin.",

            "340g ripe strawberries or equivalent fruit",
			"149g sugar",
			"0.25 of a Granny Smith green apple (green apples have a higher content in pectin. This amount is for a jelly like consistency, double it to make jam)",

    "instructions": [
        "- Start heating the oven at 110ÂºC with the clean jars inside, to sanitize but also to heat the glass so it does not break on contact with the hot jam.",
		"- Wash the fruit and cut it in smaller pieces ~0.5-1 cm",
		"- In a kitchen pot place your fruit, the sugar, lemon juice and grated skinless apple. Start heating on high and mash the fruit with a fork.",
		"- Boil for 20-25 minutes until it has a good consistency. Don't stir too much but check the bottom is not burning.",
		"- Turn off the heat and skim off the foam with a spoon. Not doing this makes the jam foamy. Pour in a jar, leaving 1 cm of free space. Remove bubbles with a skewer and close the lid tight."
    ],
    "variants": [
		"As said previously, you can swap the fruit for others.",
		"You can also make jelly by filtering the jam before pouring in the jars."

    "tips": {
        "culinary": [
			"To know it has the right consistency, take a frozen plate, put a tsp of the jam, put it back on the freezer for a minute and run a finger through the middle. If the trail is clear, it's ready.",
			"Unopened it will last about a year at room temperature. Opened it and stored in the fridge it may last from a week to two months, depending on process cleanliness.",
			"It may be obvious for some, but always use a clean spoon or knife when using it. The jam will last much more."
