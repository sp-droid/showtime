        "# Tomatoes",
		"- On a pot, put a tiny bit of oil with the tomatoes cut in half, cover and place on a low-medium heat.",
		"- After some minutes the tomatoes are soft and they are to be mashed with a fork, and left cooking on low.",
		"# Meatballs",
		"- To a beaten egg add pepper, (quite a bit of) salt, a minced clove of garlic, mix well and add the meat. Shred the bread, slightly soak in milk and mix in with the rest.",
		"- Add the 2 tbsp of oil on a pan and start heating on medium.",
		"- Using the measure of your choice (i.e. a spoon) make evenly sized meatballs, cover in flour (shake the extra flour) and brown them on at least 2 sides.",
		"- When they are done, add them to the tomato sauce, which by now can be turned off. Also remove any chunks left in the oil.",
		"# Fritura",
		"- Deglaze the pan with a very tiny splash of the wine.",
		"- Add the finely chopped onions, brown them. Sweetness is often an issue in this recipe and depends on the tomatoes, onion browning and if you decide to correct with sugar.",
		"- Add salt, finely chopped garlic, sliced carrots and cook on medium heat for at least 10-12'.",
		"- Pour in the wine, wait until it evaporates completely and turn the heat off. Now move everything to the pot.",
		"# Finishing",
		"- Pour water until the meatballs are almost submerged, add a tsp of paprika, the bay leaf, a dusting of thyme and leave for 45'-1h on low-medium heat, half-covered.",
		"- Correct for salt mid way, and check there is enough sauce or else add water."

    "variants": [
		"I read once about an Italian grandma who added 1 or 2 seedless raisins to each meatball. I simply add them to the mix after soaking them in water for a few minutes.",
		"To improve thickness and texture, adding about 4 cashews to the tomato sauce helps. Remove them after a while, blend them very finely with a bit of water and pour it back in."
