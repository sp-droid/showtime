        "# Stock",
		"- In a pot pour 1 L of water with a pinch of salt, a carrot, onion and a stalk of celery. Include here too all the leaves from the rag첫's celery.",
		"- Bring up to a simmer and leave for one hour. Only use the liquid afterwards.",
		"# Start cooking the rag첫",
		"- With a drop of oil cook the meat until brown, remove and set aside.",
		"- Cook the finely chopped onion with the oil until transparent.",
		"- Add the rest of the elements of the soffritto (celery and carrots) finely diced.",
		"- When brown (the longer, the sweeter, but be careful not to burn it), add the meat back in, together with the wine.",
		"- When the wine fully evaporates add the mashed tomatoes, black pepper, a pinch of salt, nutmeg and the stock. Bring to a simmer.",
		"# The long cooking process",
		"- The first 3 hours we will leave it uncovered, checking for water every now and then. There must be enough to cover at all times.",
		"- Now without adding more water, leave it uncovered until it reaches a slightly thick consistency. Add the milk, check and correct for salt.",
		"- Leave it almost fully covered until the total cooking time since you added the meat adds up to 6 hours."

			"Making sure the soffritto is well cooked and the wine is completely reduced is very important to ensure the dish stays on the sweet and not too acidic side. It's also not too bad to correct with a tsp of sugar if mistakes are made."
