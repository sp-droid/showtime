		"- In a pot pour 1 L of water with a pinch of salt, a carrot, onion and a stalk of celery. Include here too all the leaves from the rag첫's celery.",
		"- Bring up to a simmer and leave for one hour. Only use the liquid afterwards.",
		"# Start cooking the rag첫",
		"- With the olive oil melt the panceta until brown. Set aside but keep the oils in the pot.",
		"- Cook the finely chopped onion until transparent.",
		"- Add the rest of the elements of the soffritto (celery and carrots) finely diced.",
		"- When brown (the longer, the sweeter, but be careful not to burn it), add the meat with the pepper and nutmeg, splitting it finely with a wooden spoon until brown.",
		"- Pour in the wine, when it fully evaporates add the mashed tomatoes, a pinch of salt and the stock. Bring to a simmer.",
		"# The long cooking process",
		"- The first 2-3 hours we will leave it uncovered, checking for water every now and then. There must be enough to cover at all times.",
		"- Now without adding more water, leave it uncovered until it reaches a slightly thick consistency. Add the milk, check and correct for salt.",
		"- Leave it almost fully covered until the total cooking time since you added the meat adds up to 4-6 hours."

        "culinary": [
			"Making sure the soffritto is well cooked and the wine is completely reduced is very important to ensure the dish stays on the sweet and not too acidic side. It's also not too bad to correct with a tsp of sugar if mistakes are made.",
			"Add olive oil if the residual fat from the meat is not enough. When allowed to cool the meat releases much more fat, which you can also use."
