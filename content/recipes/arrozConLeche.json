		"- In a pot pour the milk, cream, fruit peels and cinnamon stick on medium to high heat. Once it bubbles add the rice and lower the heat to a minimum. As long as it's steaming it's okay.",
		"- Cook for 50 minutes to 2 hours. Longer times are traditional in Asturias, and the end result exchanges grain structure for a creamy texture. Both methods are worth trying. Check frequently it's not burning.",
