    "description": "Brewing coffee on a moka is easy, everybody does it. Everybody seems to be, however, used to the burnt and bitter flavour. This recipe explains how I do it for the tiramis√π since I'm not used to coffee and I really notice the bitterness otherwise. Being less bitter makes it drinkable with less sugar too. The moka is a relatively new invention, in the name of a city in Yemen renowned for its coffee: Mocha.",
