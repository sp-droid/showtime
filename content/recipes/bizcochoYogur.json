    "description": "/'Yogurt sponge cake'/ Also called queque or bizcochón, the word bizcocho comes from latin. In Ancient Rome it was referred to a type of unleavened bread that was baked twice to make it last longer. In Spain the word can actually mean both: there's also a well-known version of what the Romans had, called biscote or pan bizcochado.",

		"- Preheat the oven to 170ºC.",
		"- Empty the yogurt and use the recipient as measurement.",
		"- Mix, first eggs/sugar, then yogurt/oil/baking powder and finally add the flour slowly until combined. Doing it by hand makes it taste better for some reason.",

    "variants": [
		"On top of using the lemon yogurt, I always add the zest of a lemon",
