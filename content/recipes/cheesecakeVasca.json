		"- When the top is caramelized around 25-35', place some aluminum foil on top to prevent it from burning.",

		"Sometimes cream cheese is not available. Keeping in mind it has ~30% fat, a substitution that ends somewhere near that quantity should turn out similarly. I've done it with half ricotta (10% fat) half mascarpone (40%) and it worked out nicely."
