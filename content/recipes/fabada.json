		"- Cover the beans and saffron in water the night before. They absorb a lot of water, do make sure they have extra.",
		"- The day after, put the peeled onion, clove of garlic and beans covered with water (use the one from the night before). Bring to a boil.",
		"- Now we add a splash of cold water to stop the boiling, and boil again. we do this twice more. It's called 'scaring' the beans.",
		"- Add everything else except the salt and cook on low-medium heat for 2-3 hours. After this time correct for salt."

    "variants": [
		"The fully traditional recipe is the compango (tocino, morcilla, chorizo), water, salt and beans. But it varies from home to home, and as the dish travelled it gained a few additions. In my opinion they don't detract from the original flavour, as long as we add them in little quantities."
