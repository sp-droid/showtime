My ESA internship took place during 2023 at the European Astronaut Centre (Cologne, Germany), as ML and software developer of the CAVES & Pangaea group. Concretely, I worked in the Pangaea team for Igor Drozdovsky.

In the personal domain, I grew substantially during my stay in Cologne. More than a year has passed since I left, and I've had time to reflect on this experience. It wasn't always perfect, but it was extraordinary to be there. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason, I don't know yet. What I can say though, is that I've been living out of my home since I was 17, in different cities and countries, and only after this experience and some time to process it, I'm ready to face whatever is in front of me. It wasn't just feeling well; I have very fond memories of my time in high school in Lanzarote, and during the first years of my bachelors in Madrid; it was feeling the world was smaller. I guess that's how I can describe it now.

Focusing on my immediate colleagues, when I arrived I was well received, but with the exception of Verena (YGT), all of them were leaving less than 2 months into my own stay. After this I suddenly became the *veteran* (:sunglasses:) and new interns joined. I tried my best to help them throughout, and soon I found them helping me in different ways. Each and every one of them were so funny and unique. The atmosphere was really good and I'll probably chase that kind of work relationship forever. All of them were great people, I can attest for Igor being good at finding character and integrity.

There's more to it than this, but it's not right for this post. Thank you for reading!
