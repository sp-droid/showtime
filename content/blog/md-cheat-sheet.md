This technical post serves as first ever blog entry, cheat sheet and check for all supported markdown features I could implement.

### But before, how does it work?

I write markdown files using Typora as md editor, save them on the server and log an entry with metadata (title, filename, date, tags...) on a JSON file. Before uploading I run a script that, among other things, renders the markdown text into HTML. Since I found very good packages in JS, I'm using that language on top of node.js as package manager, called through _subprocess_ via the main python script.

The recipes part works differently. Since I am writing in plain text with custom styling, I need to run a python script for the ingredients/nutrition calculation, and the structure between recipes is shared, I'm storing the HTML files directly.

The projects part is by definition very diverse so I'm keeping it as a simple grid with links to either videos, completely different pages or nothing at all. It relies on JS to bring up the content, but I'm planning on at least statically typing the links to each project beforehand so they are visible to crawlers.

### Q&A

1. **Why not render it dynamically?**
   This entire site is hosted on Github Pages, so I can't dynamically render anything server-side. I considered and actually fully completed a Single Page Application, rendering everything client-side, but I found out how terrible its SEO capabilities were so I reverted to making them statically.
2. **Why markdown?**
   It's an easy markup language to learn and write very fast, it looks pretty by default, you can style it with different themes, it's very lightweight and it's probably the most popular tool for this purpose nowadays. Unless you are writing research papers (LaTeX is still considerably ahead) Markdown is probably The choice.
3. **Why Typora?**
   Years ago I tried a couple editors and this was the best one. It used to be free, now I believe it's behind a small 1 time fee. It's as fast as it gets, with ongoing support and you can use the theme you prefer.

# Headers

```markdown
Not showing h1 because it's of the same size as the header of every section so far.
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
My philosophy for headers is, h1 for chapters, h2 for sections (unless there are no chapters), h3 for subsections and I wouldn't use the other 3 with any organizational idea behind.

# Emphasis

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~
```

# Lists
## Ordered
```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖYou can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖTo have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖNote that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

1. Make my changes
    1. Fix bug
    2. Improve formatting
        - Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
    * Describe my changes
    * Mention all the members of my team
        * Ask for feedback

## Unordered
```markdown
* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

# Tables

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
