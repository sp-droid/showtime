- Using CNNs to supplement coarse mesh DNS direct numerical simulation, achieving similar results to fine mesh simulations in a fraction of the time.
- Using transformers to replace the long, computationally expensive and not as interesting low Re initial part of the simulation with a single inflow generator closer to the turbulence.
