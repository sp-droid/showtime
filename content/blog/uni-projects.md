For now I'm only mentioning projects that I made an animation for in the end.

## Orbital Mechanics

An interplanetary transfer design and an Earth orbit design. I had to do the last part, and this included a  We chose to do it in MATLAB. 



I went ahead and did these two animations using the same software. That was probably a mistake, it was hell on Earth to make, and motivated me to learn Blender for the same purpose later.

## Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics

Control and simulation of satellite attitude dynamics using MATLAB Simulink. Orbit trajectory computed using MATLAB and drawn with Blender.

## Launch Systems

Concept design of a 3-stage partially recoverable (parachute) missile system to deliver a non-military payload with a range of ~250km. Missile trajectory computed with MATLAB and drawn with Blender.
