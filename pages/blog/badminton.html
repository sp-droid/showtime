<h1>My badminton journey (so far!)</h1>
<h5>Reading time: 11 mins</h5>
<hr>
<p>The first time I ever touched a badminton racket happened during a physical education class in high school, just to learn the rules and play with each other over a few weeks. I really liked it. Next time was during my bachelors in university in 2018, I bought a badminton racket for 30 € and played every now and then with my friends. I tried looking for lessons and I did join one a couple times but it was pretty basic. I should've searched for a club. Then in 2024 I finally did, at 15zero in Milan, Italy, during my master's degree.</p>
<p>I'm making this blog entry mostly for myself, to record everything I'm learning, what worked and what didn't.</p>

</ul></div></p>
<div id="section1"></div>
<h1>Progress</h1>
<div id="section2"></div>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Q4 2025</strong> - I joined a competitive course where I can say I'm learning the most I've had. There are players there I can learn a lot from, and the coach is great. I participated in two tournaments in singles, lost both first round. I wasn't surprised, I practised much more doubles, but I like it so I forced myself to train it more. Towards December I had some matches where I used to struggle but now I do not. I've realised I have some bad habits, mainly postural, that I'm trying to correct as well. I'd love if someone asked me to play a tournament together, I honestly think I'm better at doubles. I do have a slight problem, in that I do cross lifts (but not angled and deep enough) and cross smashes too much. When my partner is good, it's alright, but when playing with newer players I'm making my mate's situation more difficult. I should also learn to rotate them out of the back-court, maybe telling them to do a drop and approach the net...</p>
<p>Also attended the Torneo Sociale (random pairs, win by total points) of Christmas this time around. Results were 12/19/21/19/21/21/20/21. If it weren't for that 12 point game I would have ended on the podium but well, difficult to control. I played well throughout the whole thing. I'm aware of some technical difficulties that affected the outcome also but not gonna get into that. I had a ton of fun. I enjoyed two games in particular, one played with Filippo and the other unofficially, with some great players. Had some good points in that one.</p>
<p>I kept experimenting with my training regime, also at home, I felt better than before. Had some very nice points (in a sea of mistakes). My rear-court backhand technique is getting better, I'm much more consistent... I have some ideas to take it to the next level on my own but I first need some time, which finishing my thesis doesn't leave me. It's alright, at this rate there is a lot to do still.</p>
<p><strong>Q3 2025</strong> - Playing in summer in Milan is not a good experience: 🔥🦟☔😓</p>
<p><strong>Q1Q2 2025</strong> - I joined a basic adults course but it wasn't very useful besides some technique drills. I faced stronger opponents in free play almost every time. I got more precise and my technique improved but the hip injury I faced for 3-4 months really affected me, every lunge hurt. For example I didn't beat my friend Eleonora on 3 sets once in all that time. Not saying she didn't improve, she for sure did, more than myself, but not once? Everybody has bad days, or hits a streak of bad luck. Could only take a set.</p>
<p>I did recover in time for the summer Torneo Sociale (where we play 2v2 games with random people and see who gets most points) but despite winning 7/9 games, I lost one like 13-21, so I didn't end up on the podium. I did an alright job but I wasn't happy with how I played the 13 point game.</p>
<p><strong>Q4 2024</strong> - Playing with feathers really helped me. I found a lot of joy in the sport. Since I already did weight training I was quite fast with my legs compared to others, despite having zero footwork. I got a bit more precise and gained some game sense in doubles, the improvements were consistent overall.</p>
<p>The best thing I improved on was not mistreating the feather, for some reason I had this bad habit at the beginning, especially after losing points. I also learnt quite early to lose and accept being frustrated without showing it.</p>
<p><strong>Before September 2024</strong> - Quite bad. I guess the only thing that I improved on was racket feel over the years. The first time you pick a racket it feels like a strange object, but after some time it becomes an extension of yourself.</p>
<div id="section3"></div>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<div id="section4"></div>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop playing if you notice lasting pain</strong> while playing. If recovering from a soft injury, some pain before and while warming up is normal. If you do a deep backhand and your wrist lets you know how bad your form was, it's a good reason to be careful and focus on technique.</li>
<li>Before playing you should <strong>warm up</strong> your legs especially, it doesn't matter if nobody does it, you do it. You should be sweating when you finish. Then get on to a court and finishing warming up your body by playing nets, drives and finally clears.</li>
<li>If I drunk only water I could get cramps by the end of 4 h long sessions. Just a <strong>tbsp of sports drink powder</strong> (with minerals and some glucose) seems enough to stop this.</li>
<li>If it's cold outside, <strong>wear gloves</strong> on the main hand for the walk so your hand is warm before.</li>
<li>In doubles <strong>you shouldn't be looking back</strong>, it's dangerous for the eye, so knowing where your teammate comes from peripheral vision, tactics and overall trust. Problems arise when you don't trust your teammate and want to cover more court to compensate for it, or misjudge where he is. You run backwards, or forward to his side, and clash your rackets (in the best of outcomes). <strong>Prioritise avoiding each other over winning points if you don't trust each other</strong>.</li>
<li>Having said that, if you are the one behind, eventually the call to make it a problem is yours. You CAN look at your teammate and shuttle both, <strong>it's your responsibility to retreat your hand if you are behind</strong>, even if it would have been better if you took it.</li>
<li><strong>Indoor flat walls to train drives</strong> are great. Unfortunately I don't have any appropriate ones near my home.</li>
</ul>
<div id="section5"></div>
<h2>Injury log</h2>
<p>My ankle has gone into hyper-extension quite a few times while playing but never got anything more than a scare. I can roll my ankle and put a lot of weight on it so I'll probably be fine on this at least.</p>
<p><strong>Late 2025</strong> - Small strain on my <strong>index finger ligament</strong> responsible of stabilising it when it moves sideways. Hurt when holding a heavy pan for example, because the weight rests on the index laterally. Healed in a month after soft racket drills first and then isometric finger holds.</p>
<p><strong>Early 2025</strong> - Hit <strong>near my eye</strong>, on my temple (zygomatic bone) with a racket frame. Positioning mistake and lack of awareness from my teammate ended up in me getting hit. I had to wait for a couple minutes to regain composure at it really hurt, the area was tender for 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Early 2025</strong> - Strain on my <strong>hips</strong>. I got over-training issues after going from 4 h to 12 h of play every weekend, combined with no hip strengthening on my routine and technique problems. Didn't heal for 3-4 months while playing. I tried many things, but what healed it was active rest. Hip flexion, extension, abduction and adduction, with increasing light weights and skipping a weekend without playing.</p>
<p><strong>Early 2021</strong> - <strong>Spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> two or three days after diving on concrete floor, playing with friends. I had had surgery on both lungs when I was 15 and 17, and therefore this shouldn't have happened, so I think that me being on the thinner side, having little muscle and the impact on the floor loosened some stuff. I had 3 on my right lung over the next months, did a CT scan and revealed many lung bullae on the left one too. Since then I haven't had any, and I've had worse falls. It's just a particular issue of mine I had growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Late 2018</strong> - Strain on my <strong>shoulder rotator cuff</strong> from bad technique on overhead shots. Healed in 3 months on its own, not playing.</p>
<div id="section6"></div>
<h2>Training per week, through time</h2>
<p><strong>Q4 2025</strong> - 1.5 h of formal training, 7-8 in total, I'm trying to get all my gym days back, switch up my routine to single sets to true failure, full body every other day. In between heavy racket drills. I'm also trying to get at least 1 day of cardio in there, though I can see it improving already without it. Also added short isometrics (body-weight lunge, squat and fingertip plank) morning/night for tendon health. I take some collagen, protein and vitamin c every two days before the full body workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Q3 2025</strong> - Summer is very hard to play this in Milan. Scorching hot, humid, mosquitoes biting while I play... Only go a couple times in July-August.</p>
<p><strong>Q1Q2 2025</strong> - 12 h of play, 6 after injury, I skip many gym days. I start doing heavy racket drills.</p>
<p><strong>Q4 2024</strong> - 2-4 h of play, about 3 h of strength training</p>
<div id="section7"></div>
<h2>Equipment opinions</h2>
<p>The highlights of this list are the over-grips, the insoles and the socks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Racket</strong>. The really cheap rackets are trash, not worth buying. But anything over 20 - 30 € is fine to play, as long as you can string it to the tension you are accustomed to. The limit is on the racket. There are caveats. The only difference that you can notice is the way the shaft bends on hard shots, and the weight category that impacts manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>The material used also matters, for example to play with people you don't have synergy with, a carbon fibre racket on a clash will break (like mine did. It was a good one, and I'm still traumatised), but an aluminium alloy one probably won't. I still play with my first racket ever, from this material, a thousand scratches, frame hits, racket clashes, strung to 26-28 lbs and still going.</p>
<p>Having said that, for singles and doubles (if you trust your partner well) once you get good it makes total sense to invest a little more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shuttle</strong>. I'd rather play with a broken feather than the best plastic shuttle. Most expensive part of the sport. Hopefully new synthetics like the Victor New Carbonsonic Pro shuttles will last way longer and make this less of a problem. But it really matters, otherwise the flight path is off, you can't slice it, net spins are different... Plastic skirts also deform on heavy smashes which turns them into bullets, more dangerous and games devolve into permanently smashing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>String</strong>. This is sort of like noticing if your racket bends on impact. Until that point there is not really a justification for getting something different, because you are not good enough. Me for example I think I can't notice anything better from my 30 € racket bought 7 years ago strung with BG65, I'm not there yet.</p>
<p>The tension at which you string it however... is noticeable. Just don't do big jumps in tension because it increases the shock our hand-elbow-shoulder joints go through, you can get injured. They also break more easily on mishits. You can start with 22 or so and up it a bit every time you restring it. 24, 25, 26, 27...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Base grips</strong>. Only change to towel grip if you try and like the feeling, otherwise there is no need to change the base grip of the racket. You don't even need to replace it if you put an over-grip and replace that instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-grips</strong>. Once I started getting a bit better my hand struggled with the thin base grip over the wood, it hurts. Putting a cheap over-grip really improved my feel and eliminated any pain. Once it becomes slippery some months later just replace it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Books, manuals</strong>... It's already difficult to put badminton technique into words, and it's even harder to learn from it so don't pay. I bought a small one and didn't gain anything substantial. You have free guides in video format in YouTube, free articles, forum discussions... Coaches, practise and recording yourself is better than most of that anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shoes</strong>. I'm not a big fan of dedicated shoes. I have some volleyball ones though. They do have more durability, which is enough for me to have them. I noticed they grip much more, which I strongly dislike, so I never clean the soles with water like some do. It's probably just me, because I believe that stopping your body should mainly come from  stability and body control, not a shoe that sticks to the ground. I did some investigating and everything pointed towards higher ACL, patellar and ankle injuries from the greater peak braking forces. I'm not the best person to ask in this area because my opinion goes against what 99% of people will tell you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insoles</strong>. Pretty good. More cushioning, you can replace them more often, makes shoes last longer... I tried sport gel and normal harder ones, the harder ones perform well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Socks</strong>. This was a game changer. Normal socks aren't ready for badminton. Too thin, too slippery inside the shoe. Pretty happy with Yonex socks.</p>
</li>
